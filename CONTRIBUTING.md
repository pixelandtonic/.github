# Contributing to Craft CMS

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! We really appreciate it.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Craft CMS and its first party plugins, which are hosted in the [Craft CMS organization](https://github.com/craftcms) on GitHub. These are just guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in an issue or pull request.

## Security Disclosures

If you discover a security vulnerability, please review our [Security Policy](https://github.com/craftcms/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md), then report the issue directly to us from [craftcms.com/contact](https://craftcms.com/contact). We will review and respond privately via email.

## Bug Reports & Feature Requests

Before submitting bug reports and feature requests, please search through open issues to see if yours has already been filed.

If you do find a similar issue, upvote it by adding a :thumbsup: [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Only leave a comment if you have relevant information to add.

If no one has filed the issue yet, submit a new one. Please include a clear description of the issue, and as much relevant information as possible, including a code sample demonstrating the the issue.

## Core Enhancements

If you would like to work on a new core feature or improvement, first create a Github issue for it if there’s not one already. As much as we appreciate community contributions, we are pretty selective about which sorts of features should make it into CORE rather than a separate plugin, so don’t take it the wrong way if we advise you to pursue the idea as a plugin instead.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests should clearly describe the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if there is one. If the pull request fixes a bug, it should include a new test case that demonstrates the issue, if possible.

Thanks for being awesome.
